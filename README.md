# Shopping List

Shopping sucks. Lucky for us we have a shopping list to keep track of ALL OF THE PANTS we don't have yet... but soon will.

## Specification

### Phase Zero

- Clone down this repository.

### Phase One

Users should be able to:
- Enter an item
- Enter a price for the item
- When a user hits the submit button, both the item and the price should be displayed on the DOM.
e.g. `Item: Socks Price: $5`
- The input fields should be cleared out after the item has been successfully submitted.

### Phase Two

The combined sales tax rate for Denver, CO is 7.65%... but for our purposes, let's just make it 10%.
- When a user hits the submit button, the item, price, tax amount (in dollars), and total amount (price of item + tax) should be displayed on the DOM.
e.g.: `Item: Pants Price: $14  Tax: $1.40 Total: $15.40`
(Don't worry about floating point rounding errors in Phase Two.)
- The submit button should be disabled if there is no content in either input field.
- The submit button should be enabled if there is valid content in both input fields.
- Each item should have a button that removes it from the page.

### Phase Three

- The application should not be affected by floating point rounding errors.
- Submitted items should be stored in `localStorage` and loaded when the page loads.
